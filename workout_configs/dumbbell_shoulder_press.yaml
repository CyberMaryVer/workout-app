WINDOW_NAME: "DUMBBELL SHOULDER PRESS"

TEXT: "Including the dumbbell shoulder press exercise into your shoulder routine is essential
        in order to develop strong deltoids. It’s a compound exercise that targets the anterior
        head of the deltoid and the triceps – which are both greatly involved during the press.
        Having strong anterior deltoids will also improve your strength and stability during a bench press."
